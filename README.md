# Python OOP Quiz Game

A simple command-line True/False quiz game built using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP). This project demonstrates fundamental OOP concepts like classes, objects, and methods, while providing an interactive learning experience.

## Features
- Command-line interface with clear prompts  
- True/False questions pulled from a data set  
- Score tracking and feedback after each question  
- Option to replay the quiz  

## Project Structure
- `question_model.py` – Defines the `Question` class  
- `quiz_brain.py` – Contains the `QuizBrain` class to handle quiz logic  
- `data.py` – Stores quiz questions and answers  
- `main.py` – Runs the quiz game  

## Learning Objectives
This was my first project using OOP in Python. The goal was to:
- Understand how to create and use classes and objects  
- Learn how to structure a project with multiple files  
- Implement methods to manage state (score, current question)  
- Practice user input handling and program flow  

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py`  
2. Enter `y` to start the quiz or `n` to exit  
3. Answer each question with `True` or `False`  
4. View your score at the end and choose to replay if desired  

## Notes
- Designed as a learning project, so readability and clarity were prioritized over advanced features  
- Encourages understanding of OOP concepts in a practical way
